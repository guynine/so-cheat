# so-cheat
This is my first experience in developing external cheats. The software is written in C++. The game for which this software was developed out of personal interests is called Stalker Online. The project also has a script written in Python (a simple loader that runs the game without anti-cheat) that disables anti-cheat and gives the user a convenient and understandable way to run a cheat with the game.
